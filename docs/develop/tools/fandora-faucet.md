[fandora Faucet](https://faucet.fandora.technology/) is a tool that allows you to get free FANDORA tokens on testnet to help you get started with fandora network. The tokens enable you to work with fandora features without spending real FANDORA on the mainnet.

:::note
Tokens on testnet networks have no value as they are only used for testing purposes.
