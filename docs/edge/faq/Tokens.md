## Does fandora Edge support EIP-1559?
At the moment, fandora Edge does not support EIP-1559.

## How to set the currency(token) symbol?

The token symbol is just a UI thing, so it cannot be configured or hardcoded anywhere in the network.
But you can change it when you add the network to a wallet, like Metamask, for example.
