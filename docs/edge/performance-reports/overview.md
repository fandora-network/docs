Our goal is to make a highly-performant, feature-rich and easy to setup and maintain blockchain client software.
All tests were done using the [fandora Edge Loadbot](../additional-features/stress-testing.md).
Every performance report you will find in this section is properly dated, environment clearly described and the testing method clearly explained.   

The goal of these performance tests is to show a real world performance of fandora Edge blockchain network.
Anyone should be able to get the same results as posted here, on the same environment, using our loadbot.    

All of the performance tests were conducted on the AWS platform on a chain consisting of EC2 instance nodes.
