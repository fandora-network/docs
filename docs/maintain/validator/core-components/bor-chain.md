The Bor node or the block producer implementation is the sidechain operator.

The sidechain VM is EVM-compatible. Currently, Bor is a basic Geth implementation with custom changes done to the consensus algorithm.

Block producers are chosen from the [validator](../../glossary#validator) set and are shuffled using historical Ethereum block hashes.
