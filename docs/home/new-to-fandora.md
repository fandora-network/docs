## What is a Blockchain?
Simply put, Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger for recording transactions, tracking assets and building trust. Head over to [Blockchain Basics](blockchain-basics/basics-blockchain.md) to read more.

## What is a Sidechain?
Think of a Sidechain as a clone of a 'parent' blockchain, supporting transfer of assets to and from the main chain. It is simply an alternate to parent chain that creates a new blockchain with its own mechanism of creating blocks (consensus mechanism). Connecting a sidechain to a parent chain involves setting up a method of moving assets between the chains.

## Validator and delegator roles

On the Fandora Network, you can be a validator or a delegator. See:

* Who Is a Validator
* Who Is a Delegator

## Architecture

If your goal is to become a validator, it is essential that you understand the Fandora architecture.

See [Fandora Architecture](/docs/maintain/validator/architecture).

### Components

To have a granular understanding of the Fandora architecture, see core components:

* [Heimdall](/docs/pos/heimdall/overview)
* [Bor](/docs/pos/bor/overview)
* [Contracts](/docs/pos/contracts/stakingmanager)

#### Codebases

To have a granular understanding of the core components, see the codebases:

* Heimdall
* Bor
* Contracts

## How-tos

### Node setup

* Run a Validator Node with Ansible
* Run a Validator Node from Binaries

### Staking operations

* [Validator Staking Operations](/docs/maintain/validate/validator-staking-operations)
* [Delegate](/docs/maintain/delegate/delegate)
